        "Às vezes, queremos selecionar dados com base em grupos e entender dados agregados em nível de grupo. Vimos que, embora o Pandas nos permita iterar em cada linha em um dataframe, geralmente é muito lento fazê-lo. Felizmente, o Pandas tem uma função groupby() para acelerar essa tarefa. A ideia por trás da função groupby() é que ela pega algum dataframe, divide-o em pedaços com base em alguns valores de chave, aplica computação nesses pedaços e depois combina os resultados novamente em outro dataframe. Nos pandas, isso é chamado de padrão split-apply-combine."
